# Fourier-Transformation-PI-Day-2018
A webpage with a custom JS graphing application for the Fourier Transform developed for my High School's 2018 PI day contest. 

## Overview
The page starts off by linking the 3Blue1Brown video that Inspired me to make this application:

It then goes into detail about what PI is to the fourier transformation, giving a few formulas and building up to the fourier transformation. 
Finally it gets to the application showing the computations of the fourier transformation and their graphs at each step.

## Errata
On the page I claim it only works for frequencies of 0-23hz due to the trapezoidal calculation of the integral not being precise enough, however in reality this was just my hypothesis at the time and I haven’t actually tested this. If you think you’ve found out why it only works properly for the 0-23hz range, feel free to contact me.
